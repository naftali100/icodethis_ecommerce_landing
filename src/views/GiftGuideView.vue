      <h2>Step 1: Discover Their Style</h2>

      <p>
        The key to choosing the perfect clothing gift is understanding the recipient's unique style.
        Do they prefer casual, formal, or athleisure wear? Are they a fan of vibrant colors or do
        they lean towards classic neutrals? Take a moment to think about their wardrobe preferences.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 2: Consider the Occasion</h2>

      <p>
        Is the gift for a special occasion like a birthday, anniversary, or holiday celebration?
        Different events call for different attire. For instance, a cozy sweater might be ideal for
        a winter birthday, while a stylish swimsuit is perfect for a summer vacation.
